# Quick LaTeX course

## LaTeX installation


### Online environment: Overleaf

To start, we recommend you use the [online LaTeX environment Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) since it has a full installation of LaTeX and there is nothing to install.

### Local installation

If you want to use LaTeX locally (it's faster to compile) then you need either:

  - [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/about) (Windows) 
  - [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex) (macOS). 
  - [TeXLive](https://www.tug.org/texlive) (Linux)


## Getting started

Follow the [Overleaf's Learn LaTeX in 30min](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes) to start.

The only crucial thing missing from it is how to add references, for this we suggest you use "natbib" ([tutorial about bibliography management with natbib](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Bibliography_management_with_natbib)).


## Tips and tricks for LaTeX

The [MSc Geomatics thesis template](https://github.com/tudelft3d/msc_geomatics_thesis_template) has several tips for advanced use of LaTeX.

The file (`chapters/introduction.tex`)[] contains several tips that are useful when using LaTeX, read its source code!


## Which software to use? (if you don't use Overleaf)

### Editors

  - [TeXnicCenter](http://www.texniccenter.org) (Windows)
  - [TeXStudio](https://www.texstudio.org/) (Windows)
  - [TeXshop](http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/) (macOS; which is bundled with MacTeX)

### Managing references

  - [JabRef](http://jabref.sourceforge.net) (cross-platform)

### Drawing figures

  - Adobe Illustrator (nice, but €€€)
  - [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) (cross-platform)
  - [IPE](http://ipe.otfried.org/) (cross-platform; integrates LaTeX text; great for triangulation and geometric stuff)

### Drawing flowcharts

  - [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/)  


### Help to draw tables

  - [Tables Generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/) (LaTeX tables are tough to type and align, this helps greatly to start)# latex-getting-started
